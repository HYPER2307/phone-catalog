### Technologies Used
- **JSX**: Used to write React components with HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
- **SCSS**: Utilized for styling components with advanced CSS features and maintaining stylesheets in a more organized manner.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: Naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS, ensuring readability and reusability of styles.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, managing component-based architecture.
- **React Router**: Manages the navigation between views in the application, handling routing dynamically.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist user data like cart items and login state across browser sessions.
- **Query Params**: Employs URL query parameters for maintaining the state of application (e.g., filters, search terms).

## Installation Instructions
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your system.
   - A modern web browser.

   This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Usage Instructions
- **Navigating the Store:** Use the navigation bar to switch between different views such as Home, Products, and Cart.
- **Adding Items to Cart:** Click on any product to view its details and add it to the cart.
- **Checkout Process:** The cart can be viewed at any time by navigating to the Cart page where users can proceed to checkout or modify their order.
- **Search and Filter:** Products can be searched or filtered based on various criteria using the query parameters in the URL.

## Configuration
- **SCSS Compilation:** Ensure SCSS files are compiled to CSS. This can be automated within the project setup using tools like Webpack or create-react-app.
- **Routing Setup:** Configure React Router in the `src/App.js` file to include all necessary routes and redirects.
